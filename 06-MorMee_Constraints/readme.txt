The spread-sheet "MorMee-PowerConstraints.xlsx" contains the list of criterion properties to express Power Use Constraints (PUC) 
to limit the use of mandator or mandatee empowerment.

Beware that:

1. The names and definitions of the constraints are given in the file MorMeeConstraintType.ttl, which is part of the RPaM OWL-DL-TTL artefatcs
2. This file adds information that is needed to specify PUCs, namely the type of the constraint (with semantic load, e.g. FinancialCeil, ValidityPeriod, etc.), the type of data (e.g. Amount, Period, etc.), other. See the file: 
https://github.com/everis-rpam/RPaM-Ontology/blob/v1.1.0/03-Syntax_Bindings/OWL-DL-TTL/rpam/thesauri/MorMeeConstraintType.ttl.

For details on the Criterion Property see the Core Criterion and Evidence Vocabulary (CCEV) in the RPaM documentation.

The ongoing modelling of Mandate foresees to decouple the constraints from within the Empowerment and reuse the
Core Criterion and Evidence Vocabulary (CCEV) to express these constraints.
