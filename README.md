# RPaM Ontology

The ultimate objective of the Representation Powers and Mandates Ontology (RPaM Ontology) is to put forth a commonly agreed vocabulary that will conceptualise, formally encode and make available in an open, structured and machine-readable format data about the representation of powers and mandates, covering it from end to end. It is the intention of the vocabulary to unify existing practices, thus facilitating seamless exchange, access and reuse of data.

In the framework of this project, we will identify and give examples of each step of the process and phases for creating the Core Vocabulary of Powers and Mandates.

In parallel to this process, a working group composed of stakeholders from multiple interested groups will be set up. This working group will decide by consensus on how the vocabulary should be developed at all stages and may decide to adopt the first draft of the specification proposed and described during the first meeting. This project will provide the working group with the process, methodology and technology to be followed for developing the final version of the Core Vocabulary of Powers and Mandates.

* Modification of the [Conceptual Data Model v1.1.0](https://github.com/everis-rpam/RPaM-Ontology/wiki/Conceptual-Model-v1.1)
* Refactoring of the corresponding [TTL files](https://github.com/everis-rpam/RPaM-Ontology/tree/v1.1.0/02-Vocabularies/RPaM)
* Update of the [EU Powers Taxonomy](https://github.com/everis-rpam/RPaM-Ontology/blob/master/02-Vocabularies/RPaM/EU_Powers_Taxonomy.ttl)
* Update of the [Business Rules](https://github.com/everis-rpam/RPaM-Ontology/tree/v1.1.0/04-%20Business%20Rules)
* Creation of specifications supporting the implementation of the ontology. [See Wiki](https://github.com/everis-rpam/RPaM-Ontology/wiki)

## Version 1.0.0 (10/04/2019)

This is the first release of the RPaM Ontology-related deliverables, which encompasses namely:

* A draft version of the [RPaM Glossary](https://github.com/everis-rpam/Core-Vocabulary/blob/master/01-Glossary/Glossary_and_Acronyms.xlsx)
* The Conceptual Data Model ([CDM v1.0.0](https://github.com/everis-rpam/RPaM-Ontology/wiki/Conceptual-Model-v1.0))
* A proposal of an extension for the ISA2 CPSV-AP (Core Public Service Vocabulary - Appplication Profile) (see diagram in the [EAP file](https://github.com/everis-rpam/RPaM-Ontology/blob/master/02-Vocabularies/RPaM/RPaM.EAP))
* Draft OWL-DL Turtle ([TTL](https://github.com/everis-rpam/RPaM-Ontology/blob/master/02-Vocabularies/RPaM/RPaM_Ontology.ttl)) implementation of the RPaM Ontology and other reused [vocabularies](https://github.com/everis-rpam/RPaM-Ontology/tree/master/02-Vocabularies)
* A proposal for the reuse of the ISA2 CCEV (Core Criterion Vocabulary) for the expression of [information requirements and constraints](https://github.com/everis-rpam/RPaM-Ontology/blob/master/02-Vocabularies/RPaM/SP-InformationRequirements.xlsx)
