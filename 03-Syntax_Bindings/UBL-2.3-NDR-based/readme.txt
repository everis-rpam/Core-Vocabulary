This folder contains the tools used to generate the UBL-2.3 XSD Schema compatible with the NDR-3.0 and ISO 15000-5 Core Component Technical Specification.

Beware that:

1. The version 2.3 of the UBL-TC is currently being developed (as per February 2019) and should be ready for
review by mid-2019. The previous stable version is 2.2;
2. Although the version 2.2 defined criteria, these were `semantised` for eProcurement as `TenderingCriterion`;
3. Our proposal is to define a generic Criterion model that can be reused in a business-domain-agnostic way. RPÃ¢M,
jointly with other European Commission projects are good business cases for UBL to get enriched and improved;
4. everis, as a voting member of the UBL-TC is proposing the inclusion of this generic Criterion model into UBL;
5. However, for backwards compatibility reasons, it seems improbable that it can be taken on board of the version 2.3 of UBL;
6. This fact does not preclude that the RPaM pilots could use a custom extension of the UBL-2.3 specification that
is compatible with its NDRs (Naming and Design Rules).

If you need to use them for your own purposes, please:
